# pie-pixel-painter
A little pixel editing tool.

It's currently support only painting to canvas and creating new empty canvases.

Supported tools are painter, eraser, color picker and filler.

Uses `tkinter` and `ttk` as GUI libraries.

I made it to learn more about tkinter and GUI programming, as a whole.

## Requiriments:
Nothing except `Python3`. 

## How to use it:
First, click the **GREEN CODE BUTTON** and choose **DOWNLOAD ZIP**.

Extract the zip to a folder.

Then double-click on `main.py` and that's it!
